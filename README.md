FreedomSquares are the free and open source version of MealSquares. We used the ingredient list from the MealSquares website and created a slightly lower carb version of MealSquares. 

Ingredients should make these come out to about 50 cents a square, which is much cheaper than a $3 MealSquare. 

Unlike MealSquares, FreedomSquares are not milk free or flour free but you may substitute milk for soymilk for slightly higher protein content, and quinoa flour for all purpose flour to avoid flour.

Each square is 400 calories and contains 
28% daily recommended fiber
28% daily recommended protein
24% daily recommended fat
18% daily recommended carbohydrates

We'd love pull requests!
